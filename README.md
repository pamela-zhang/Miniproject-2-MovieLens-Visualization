# MovieLens-Visualization
## CS 155 MiniProject 2 
### Description of Miniproject
In this project, you will be creating visualizations of the MovieLens data set using matrix factorization. The MovieLens data set consists of 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies, where each user has rated at least 20 movies. The last 19 fields are various movie genres. Here, a 1 indicates the movie is of the given genre, while a 0 indicates that it is not. Note that movies can be in several genres at once. The movie ids correspond to the movie ids specified in the data.txt file and range from 1 to 1682.
